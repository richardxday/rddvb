rddvb - a DVB auto-scheduler

What is rddvb?

rddvb is a system designed to automatically schedule the recording of
TV programmes using a DVB card.  It uses TV listings from xmltv
(although other inputs are possible) and user generated 'patterns' to
decide which programmes need recording, scheduling the recordings to
record as many programmes as possible.

Features

* Web based interface controlling scheduling, editing patterns, etc.
* Automatic download and scanning of TV listings ('cron' based)
* 'at' based record scheduling
* Maintains lists of TV programmes:
  * TV listings
  * Recorded programmes
  * Scheduled programmes
  * Rejected programmes
* Multiple sets of TV listings can be used (e.g. Sky and Freeview) -
  only one source can be used to schedule programmes however
* Disk space monitoring (with warning levels)
* Multi-user
* Per-programme and per-user configurations
* Explicit and implicit scheduling prioritization
* Configurable post-processing of recordings
* Repeat detection
* Episode / series awareness (each episode only recorded once)
* Advanced, multi-parameter searching with regex
* Uses dvbstream to record programmes
* Supports multiple DVB cards for handling clashing recordings
* DVB card can be specified on per-user or per-programme basis
